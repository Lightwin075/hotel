- Reservation management for staff
- Check-in/check-out processing
- Booking calendar and availability display
- Reservation modification and cancellation

## Guest Management
- Guest profile creation and management
- Guest history and preferences tracking
- Contact information management
- Special requests and notes

## Billing and Payments
- Invoice generation and management
- Payment processing and tracking
- Room rate calculations
- Additional charges (room service, amenities)
- Payment history and receipts

## Staff Management
- Staff login and role-based access
- Housekeeping task assignment
- Staff performance tracking
- Shift management

## Multi-Language Support
- Spanish and English language support
- User language preference management
- Dynamic language switching
- Translation management system
- Localized content for all user interfaces

## Data Management and Export
- Soft delete implementation for all entities
- Audit trail for data modifications
- SQL Server export functionality
- Configurable export schedules
- Data export monitoring and logging

# User Experience  
## User Personas
- Hotel Staff: Front desk, housekeeping, management
- Guests: Booking rooms, managing reservations
- Administrators: System configuration and oversight

## Key User Flows
- Guest booking flow: Search availability → Select room → Enter details → Payment → Confirmation
- Check-in flow: Guest arrival → Verify booking → Assign room → Issue keys → Update status
- Check-out flow: Guest departure → Room inspection → Final billing → Payment processing → Room status update
- Housekeeping flow: Task assignment → Status updates → Room inspection → Completion reporting

## UI/UX Considerations
- Mobile-responsive design for staff tablets and guest mobile access
- Intuitive navigation with clear visual hierarchy
- Real-time updates and notifications
- Accessibility compliance
- Multi-language support for international guests (Spanish and English)
- Language switching functionality with persistent user preferences

- Backend: Node.js/Express.js REST API
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Authentication: JWT-based user authentication
- File Storage: Local file system for documents and images
- Email Service: SMTP integration for notifications

## Data Models
- Users (staff, guests, administrators)
- Rooms (types, status, pricing)
- Reservations (bookings, check-in/out dates)
- Guests (profiles, preferences, history)
- Billing (invoices, payments, charges)
- Housekeeping (tasks, status, assignments)
- Language preferences and translations
- Audit logs for soft delete operations
- Export configurations and schedules

## APIs and Integrations

- Staff performance tracking
- Shift management system
- Internal communication features
- Mobile-responsive staff interface

## Phase 5: Advanced Features and Optimization
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Multi-language support (Spanish and English)
- SMS notifications
- Integration with external services
- Performance optimization
- Advanced search and filtering
- Soft delete implementation across all modules
- SQL Server export functionality
- Data export scheduling and automation

# Logical Dependency Chain
## Foundation First (Phase 1)
- Database schema and API foundation must be established first
- User authentication system is required before any user-specific features
- Room management is the core data that everything else depends on
- Basic reservation system provides immediate value and validates the core concept

## Quick Win Frontend (Phase 1)
- Simple booking interface that works end-to-end
- Room availability display
- Basic admin interface for room management
- This creates a usable product quickly for demonstration and testing

## Building Upon Foundation (Phase 2-3)
- Enhanced booking features build on the basic reservation system
- Guest management extends the user system
- Billing system integrates with existing reservations and guests
- Each phase adds value while maintaining system stability

## Operational Excellence (Phase 4-5)
- Staff management enhances operational efficiency
- Advanced features optimize and extend the core functionality
- Performance and scalability improvements ensure long-term viability

# Risks and Mitigations  
## Technical Challenges
- Risk: Complex booking logic and date handling
- Mitigation: Thorough testing and validation of date calculations, edge case handling

- Risk: Payment integration complexity
- Mitigation: Use established payment gateways with good documentation and support

- Risk: Real-time updates and synchronization
- Mitigation: Implement proper state management and WebSocket connections where needed

## MVP Scope Management
- Risk: Feature creep extending development timeline
- Mitigation: Strict adherence to MVP requirements, defer non-essential features to later phases

- Risk: Over-engineering the initial system
- Mitigation: Start with simple, working solutions that can be enhanced later

## Resource Constraints
- Risk: Limited development resources
- Mitigation: Prioritize features by business value, use proven technologies and libraries

- Risk: Database performance with growing data
- Mitigation: Implement proper indexing, query optimization, and consider pagination from the start
